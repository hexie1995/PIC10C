# PIC10C
This page contain the content and projects for UCLA 2019 WINTER PIC10C class.

There are two homeworks: HW1_A and HW1_B, and HW2. 

* HW1_A is a simple game which contains a bet game.
* HW1_B is a customized vector class.
* HW2 is a calculator for PIC10B class.

* There are also two final projects: one is a PDE solver, the other one is a plotting try out.
* The plotting project may contain a lot of different plotting examples just to explore how to plot in real time.
* The A PDE solver in C++ that can be used to solve transportation, wave and heat equation. Please refer to different folders for content. PDE solver is only ready for solving transportation at this point. Please cite the webpage if you found this helpful. 


Special Thanks to Professor Chris Anderson at UCLA Math Department for useful conversation about PDE solver.
