# PIC10C
This page contain the content and projects for UCLA 2019 WINTER PIC10C class.

There are three homeworks: HW1_A and HW1_B, HW2 and HW3.

* HW1_A is a simple game which contains a bet game.
* HW1_B is a customized vector class.
* HW2 is a calculator for PIC10B class.
* HW3 is a ringque that is customized.

* There are also two final projects: one is a PDE solver, the other one is a plotting try out. I want to try plotting with QT because I want to eventually plot out the solution to the PDE.
* The plotting project may contain a lot of different plotting examples just to explore how to plot in real time.
* The plotting project contain two youtube videos for demonstrating what is going on with two different python code.
* The A PDE solver in C++ that can be used to solve transportation, wave and heat equation. Please refer to different folders for content. PDE solver is only ready for solving transportation at this point. Please cite the webpage if you found this helpful. 
* The ongoing pde solver use a c++ header file from the following github: https://github.com/apmcollab/SCC-DoubleVectorNd
* Special thanks to Professor Ricardo Salazar for all his help in this class and ideas about projects.
* Special Thanks to Professor Chris Anderson at UCLA Math Department for useful conversation about PDE solver and for the github for doublevector.
